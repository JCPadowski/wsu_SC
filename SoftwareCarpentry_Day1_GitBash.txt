Unix Shell BASH

~~~~A few commands~~~~~~~~~
echo= prints whatever you write after it
ls= list items in current directory
-l = flag gives you long format output

can get back the last command with the up arrow
if want to get up one level in a directory: cd ..

ex. ls -l ~/Desktop = lists all the stuff on your desktop

pwd = tells you what directory you're in (equiv to getwd() in R)

cd = change working directory.  if you want to change it back to your home directory, just use a  "cd ~"

can use long directory format, or if you know where you are and want to drill down further, can just list the folder 

can access folders w/ spaces in title by putting it in quotations
"cd /Users/Julie/Desktop/Statistical Learning"

~~~~~~~Challenge #1~~~~~~~~~~~
- Navigate to Desktop
cd C:/Users/Julie/Desktop
or
cd ~/Desktop

- List contents
ls

- Back to home directory
cd ~
or
ls ~/Desktop

~~~~~More on listing stuff~~~~~~~~~~
When looking in a folder with -l
can see who has privlegdges to read/write, what group a person belongs to, size of files in bytes, modification time/date, file name

ls has lots of other functions than -l
ls -a lists hidden files (usu. starts with a .filename, if up one directory its ..filename)
ls -l lists long format
ls -lh lists files as "human readable" file sizes
ls -S sort by file size
ls -t sort by when modified

~~~~Challenge #2~~~~~~~
- Pick a new directory
cd "C:/Users/Julie/Desktop/Statistical Learning"

- list files in long format, by file size, with human readable file sizes
ls -lhS

~~~~~~ A few more functions for file viewing~~~~~~~~~~~
In GitBash, help isn't available but it is online, or you can use function double-dash help (ex. ls --help)

head file.csv gives first 6 lines of file

wc file.csv will show the line, word and byte count for a file

~~~~~File Modifications~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new empty file; touch NAME
Remove a file: rm -i NAME 
Making notes: use command "nano"
Create a new directory: mkdir testdirectory
Create multiple directories at same time mkdir dir1 dir2
Copying files: cp filename locationtosave
Moving files: mv filename locationtomove

 ~~~~~~Challenge #3~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create two new directories in our class folder, one named "R" and the other named "figures"

mkdir C:/Users/Julie/Documents/wsu_SC/R
mkdir C:/Users/Julie/Documents/wsu_SC/figures

Copying a bunch of files
Make a new folder on the desktop: mkdir scratchpad
Redirect to new directory: cd scratchpad
Make a few new directories in scratchpad: mkdir dira dirb dirc
Copy all the files from wsu_SC into the scratchpad directory: cp C:/Users/Julie/Documents/wsu_SC*.R .

To remove a whole directory: rm -r scratchpad

~~~~~~Challenge #5 ~~~~~~~~~
Using the shell create a folder on the desktop with materials from this workshop like this:

swc-wsu
- data/
--data here
- figures/
-- figures here
- notes/
-- notes here
- R/
-- notes here

mkdir swc-wsu
mkdir data figures notes R
cd C:/Users/Julie/Documents/wsu_SC
mv *.csv C:/Users/Julie/Desktop/swc-wsu/data
mv notes.txt C:/Users/Julie/Desktop/swc-wsu/notes
mv *.R C:/Users/Julie/Desktop/swc-wsu/R
mv testplot.pdf C:/Users/Julie/Desktop/swc-wsu/figures

~~~~~Wildcards~~~~~~~~~~~
*  matches any character (can be multiple)
? matches a single character
[water] matches whats in the brackets
