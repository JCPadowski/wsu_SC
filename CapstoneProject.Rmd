I'm interested in the following three countries: South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("C:/Users/Julie/Documents/wsu_SC/gapminder.csv")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
TriNations <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("South Africa", "New Zealand", "Australia")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=year, x=lifeExp)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(~country)
  plot(TriNations)
```
